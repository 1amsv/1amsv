### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Pursuing Undergraduate Student in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) with
passion for new technologies, and always learning to add new skills in my skill set.
I am a hardworking person but a believer in working smart. Always prepared to face
any challenges in my life, and I see them as opportunities that give me a chance to
learn and grow. As of now, I have spent almost 3 years in learning engineering
concepts and technologies related to Data Structure and Algorithms as well as in
Java. I am also an active competitive coder, and fond of Problem Solving. My next
step is towards learning React Native for cross platform application development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating applications with Java. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cloud Computing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Open Source Project.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Application Development.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
